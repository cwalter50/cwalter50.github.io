# OutOfTime!

OutOfTime! is an interactive game that you can play with the music on your iOS device. Your music will play for a random amount of time, and your group will take turns listing items in a category or passing an object around. If the music stops and it is your turn, you lose!

OutOfTime! is the perfect game if you have minutes or hours. The game can be played with 2 people or very large groups. The game is great for all ages from young to old. Everyone can have fun playing along.

The ways you can play OutOfTime! are endless. With "Just Music" you can play classic games like 'Hot Potato', 'Musical Chairs', or invent a game where music will play for a random amount of time.

Note: This game is designed to play music from your device. You can play the game with our default music, but to maximize the potential we recommend you have at least one song on your device.

How to Play:

Music will play for a random amount of time and players in the game will take turns listing items for a given category.  If the music stops when it is your turn, you lose.  If a player is stuck they can skip to the next topic, but they will suffer a 5-second penalty before they see a new category.  No repeats and the previous player decides if a questionable response is valid.
